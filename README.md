# Real-Time Data Pipeline with Apache Kafka and Spark

This project demonstrates a robust, scalable, and high-throughput data pipeline leveraging Apache Kafka and Apache Spark. The pipeline is designed to process streaming data in real time, transforming and ingesting it for downstream analytics and data-driven applications.

## Project Overview

The **Real-Time Data Pipeline** project aims to capture, process, and analyze data in real time. Built on the strengths of Kafka’s distributed messaging capabilities and Spark’s powerful processing engine, this pipeline is ideal for high-volume environments where timely data insights are critical.

## Features

- Real-Time Data Ingestion: Uses Apache Kafka to capture data from various sources with minimal latency.
- Scalable Stream Processing: Leverages Apache Spark for fast, fault-tolerant processing, enabling transformations and enrichments on the fly.
- High Throughput: Optimized to handle large data volumes efficiently without compromising on performance.
- Extensibility: Modular architecture allows easy integration of new data sources and destinations.

## Architecture

1. **Data Source**: Simulated data streams or real-world sources, such as IoT sensors, web logs, or APIs.
2. **Ingestion Layer**: Apache Kafka, acting as the distributed messaging backbone, captures and transports data.
3. **Processing Layer**: Apache Spark processes data in real time, performing aggregations, transformations, and data enrichment.
4. **Storage Layer**: Processed data is stored in a target destination, such as a database or data lake, for downstream analytics.
5. **Monitoring & Logging**: Tools like Prometheus and Grafana (or an equivalent) to monitor pipeline health and performance metrics.

## Tech Stack

- Apache Kafka: For reliable, distributed data ingestion.
- Apache Spark: For real-time data processing and transformation.
- Prometheus & Grafana: For monitoring system performance and alerting.
- Docker: To containerize the services for easy deployment and scalability.

## Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data_pipeline.git
   cd data_pipeline
   ```

2. **Docker Compose Setup**:
   Make sure Docker is installed and running. Spin up the containers with:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

3. **Configuration**:
   Adjust the configurations for Kafka and Spark in their respective config files, located in the `config/` directory.

4. **Data Simulation**:
   Use the provided scripts in the `data_simulation/` folder to simulate a data stream. You can modify the data frequency and structure based on your testing needs.

## Usage

- **Starting the Pipeline**: Once all services are up, initiate data streaming by running:
  ```bash
  python data_simulation/stream_data.py
  ```

- **Monitoring**: Access the Grafana dashboard (or your monitoring tool) to view real-time metrics on pipeline performance.

## Data Flow Example

1. **Producer** sends messages to Kafka topics.
2. **Spark** consumes messages, applies transformations, and enriches data.
3. **Sink** stores processed data for analytics and reporting.

## Future Enhancements

- Machine Learning Integration: Add predictive models for real-time insights.
- Error Handling & Retry Mechanisms: Improve fault tolerance and resilience.
- Support for Additional Data Formats: JSON, Avro, and more.
